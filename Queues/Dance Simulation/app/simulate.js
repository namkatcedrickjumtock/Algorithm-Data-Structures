// Task 
// As we mentioned earlier, queues are often used to simulate situations when people have
// to wait in line. Once scenario we can simulate with a queue is a square dance for singles.
// When men and women arrive at this square dance, they enter the dance hall and stand
// in the line for their gender. As room becomes available on the dance floor, dance partners
// are chosen by taking the first man and woman in line. The next man and woman move
// to the front of their respective lines. As dance partners move onto the dance floor, their
// names are announced. If a couple leaves the floor and there is not both a man and a
// woman at the front of each line, this fact is announced.
